# Advent Of Vue 2022

## Problem description

'Tis the season for Christmas music! Unfortunately, the grumpy ol' grinch has snuck in and stolen some code from our festive Christmas radio.

The looted code used to live in `composables/useCurrentTrack.vue` and was centered around interacting with the [useMediaControls](https://vueuse.org/core/usemediacontrols/#usemediacontrols) composable from [VueUse](https://vueuse.org/).

Fill in the missing code (marked with `//greasy grinch footprints!`) to get the radio working again.

If you're up for a super tricky but entertaining challege, wipe out app.vue completely and come up with a Christmas Radio of your own! ðŸš€
